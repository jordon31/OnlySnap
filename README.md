## Usage

To start the script, run the python file `of-scr.py`. The script will ask you to select the profile you want to download content from, using the auto-complete feature for profile names (TAB). You can use the TAB key at the start of the search to see the complete list of profiles and select with the arrow keys.

The downloaded content will be saved in a directory named "profiles" in the same location as the script. Each profile will have its own subdirectory, containing folders for photos, videos, avatar, header, and archived posts.

### Advanced Search

To search for content based on keywords, enter a query when prompted to select a profile. The script will return all posts that contain the specified keyword(s).

## Known Issues

- The script may not work if the OnlyFans API changes.
- Due to the nature of the content, the script may not work with some profiles.
