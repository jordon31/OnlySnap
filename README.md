#  OnlySnap V2 -- a update? what???

**Yoooo**

This project was **COOKED**. Deadass forgotten for 3 years. But I locked in, cracked a Monster, and rewrote the whole thing.

We ain't using basic scripts anymore. We got a **TUI** (Terminal User Interface)

**Check this out:** No more sweating over `cmd` commands or typing manual inputs
You can literally **CLICK** on stuff now.

It's stupid easy. Other tools out there require a PhD in coding to run; mine is built different. **EZ.** No complex garbage, just click and download.

## HOW TO START (video for fast)

`.bat` for fast

1.  **Python 3.10+** required.
2.  Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3.  Click `run.bat`.
4.  Video: [tutorial](https://youtu.be/5tMwjg5hXNY)

### THE LAUNCHER

Inside `run.bat` you have 2 options. Don't mess this up.

* **[1] AUTO-PASTE (DO THIS FIRST!):**
    * Go to Browser -> F12 -> Network -> Click on "Fetch/XHR" -> chat api for no miss nothing. [chats](https://onlyfans.com/my/chats)
    * Copy the headers/request.
    *  [![Screenshot](https://i.postimg.cc/TwS30f62/Screenshot-2026-02-09-021826.png)](https://postimg.cc/7G34Yvhj)
    * Run Option 1. The script **yeets** the cookies straight into the config. No manual copy-paste struggle.
* **[2] START ONLYSNAP:**
    * Opens the main app.

## ⚙️ SETTINGS (STOP EDITING JSON FILES)

You don't need to touch `Config.json` like a caveman anymore. 

Inside the app, there is a **[SETTINGS]** button. Click it.
You can change everything there. But if you are confused, here is what the buttons do:

| Setting | Translation for Dummies |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Month Names** | `true` = "January", `false` = Numbers. Aesthetic choice. |
| **No Year Folders** | If `true`, it dumps everything in one place. Chaotic evil. |
| **Skip Highlights Covers** | Saves space. Who looks at covers anyway? |
| **Flatten Highlights** | `true` = Removes folders for highlights. Total mess. Don't do it. |
| **Disable Text Files** | `true` = Creates specific folders (Photos/Videos). `false` = Dumps everything in a "Post" folder with the caption text. I keep this ON (true) cause I'm organized. |
| **Download Tagged** | Downloads SPAM/ADS (#ad, #adv). Keep it `false` unless you love commercials. |
| **Merge Tagged** | Mixes photos/videos from ads in one folder. |
| **Download Labels** | Downloads custom lists/labels from the creator. |
| **Workers (Threads)** | Speed. Default is 5. If you have a potato PC, don't touch it. |
