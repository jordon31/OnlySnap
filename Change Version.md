# Change Log

## Version 0.8

- Updated API OnlyFans

- Join on Telegram for update :)

## Version 0.7

- Changed "dynamicRules" link which solves the "'str' object does not support item assignment" issue.
- Improved subscriber cache -- now detects when you subscribe to a new profile and automatically updates without manually deleting the .json file.
- Added new profile cache (when you visit a profile for the first time and need to re-enter the profile to download only the latest media, now with the cache you don't have to make all the requests from scratch.. (excluding stories / chat / highlights)
- Added "#!/usr/bin/env python3"
- Made the #ADV blocks more robust by adding new tag blocks + DM.
